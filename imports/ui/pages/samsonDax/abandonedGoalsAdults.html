    <h4>Welcome</h4>
    <p>
      You are invited to participate in a study that is led by Alexander Green, Sam Clarke, Stephen Butterfill and John Michael.
    </p>
    <h4>Potential risks</h4>
    <p>
      Any risks associated with participation in this experiment are equivalent to those encountered in normal everyday life conditions.
    </p>
    <h4>Your rights as a participant</h4>
    <p>
      Participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate, and you may withdraw at any time during the study without giving any reason. After you have completed or withdrawn from the study, you may ask that your data be voided.
    </p>
    <h4>Data storage and protection</h4>
    <p>
      Your personal information or experiment results will not be shared with any other participants. 
      Any information we collect from you will be held confidential and your personal information 
      will be separate from your experiment results. All data we collect from you will thus be anonymous. 
      After publication, your anonymised data may be made available in an online repository 
      for the scientific community.

Had a problem with the atmposhere package materialize:materialize

Therefore:
  Downloaded the source for that package version 0.100.2 from https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/
  (specifically https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/releases/download/v0.100.2/materialize-src-v0.100.2.zip)
  Copied the sass files and materialize.min.js to /client
  meteor install fourseven:scss (so that sass files compile!)
  ran meteor npm i jquery hammerjs
  It works again!
